    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I am a battering ram shaped like a person. At my current employment and in my personal life, my favourite tasks are the ones that I have to throw myself into, over and over, until I find a way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      My days are spent searching for sleek and functional workarounds for clients; supporting people in their day-to-day use of our software; testing hundreds of use cases at a time to help our dev teams perform QA; coding forms using JS methods I've never seen prior to a Google search 3 minutes before; and working with internal and external teams to help get our platform end-user ready from a product, design, and platform standpoint. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I take a hands-on approach to finding resolutions. If I don't know how to do something, I'll simply learn.
