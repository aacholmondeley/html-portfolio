    <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Aishah Cholmondeley, and I am learning how to code!
    </p>
    <p>
      My career has been a winding journey so far. I graduated from McGill University in 2019 with a B.Ed in Teaching ESL, found my way to an educational technology company called Studyo, and there began an interest in how millions of useful tools and websites are brought to life every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I am happily working as a Senior Customer Success Manager at a legal tech company called Estateably. I tackle the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing onboarding sessions to users</li>
      <li>Supporting users through technical aspects of our platform</li>
      <li>Acting as a liason between users and product/development teams</li>
      <li>Using JSON files/basic Javascript functions to complete client customizations</li>
      <li>On professional services/enterprise projects:
        <ul>
          <li>Acting as a Business Analyst; collecting design requirements from the end-users/external project team and relaying them to our internal teams</li>
          <li>Creating content for proof-of-concept sessions based on client's current process gaps to highlight potential improvements</li>
          <li>Using JSON/Javascript to complete custom configuration tasks and create reports for clients</li>
          <li>Responding to client UAT feedback</li>
          <li>Updating both internal and external stakeholders regularly on action items I own</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So far, most of what I've learned about web programming has either come up on the job or was self-taught, but I've really enjoyed the opportunities it has opened up for me. Coding documents to generate successfully, finding creative solutions to problems, and debugging tricky bits of code have easily become my favourite moments at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope that as I learn how to code I can improve as a BA, as well as better my understanding of our platform and its code. I'm also excited to take on my own projects, as I've really enjoyed learning how to code and am looking forward to putting my new skills to work! 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd love to connect with  other web development learners and people in similar roles; please see my <a href="./contact.html">Contact Page</a> if you'd like to reach out. I am quite friendly, albeit a touch awkward. :)
    </p>
    <h3>Not Strictly Professional Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Here are some things about me that have nothing do with work.<br/>I have written the factoids in descending order of importance (however, I'm afraid none of them really are).
    </p>
    <ol reversed>
      <li>
        <h4>The rise of remote work is one of the best things that ever happened to me.</h4>
        <p>
          The last time I left my rheumatologist's office, she made a joke.
        </p> 
        <p>
          "You know you don't need to get every single autoimmune disease, right? You don't win anything if you collect all of them."
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope she's wrong, because I could use a consolation prize. I have had some pretty gnarly symptoms and weird diseases over the past few years, but thanks to being remote, I've been able to keep doing what I enjoy through tough times. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, I've learned how important work-life balance is (can't do what you love if you're dead, after all), but if not for both Studyo and Estateably's openness to WFH policies, I'd probably be forced into long-term medical leave or unemployment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So remember, employers: not all of us want to work from home out of laziness or a desire to fly under the radar! Some of us just need to be near our landlines all day just in case the National Autoimmune Disease Sweepstakes call with good news. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Social media is not my thing.</h4>
        <p>
          I'll keep this short, because I am not going to say anything unique. I hate all of it. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn... all of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I get that in this day and age, not having much of an online presence is a bit of a red flag. However, I can assure you I'm not hiding a dark secret or a hobby in serial murder; it's just not my thing. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Cats are my favourite animals.</h4>
        <p>
          They're cute!
        </p>
        <p>
          My wife and I had a wonderful old dame named Béchamel; we lost her at 11 years old in Feb. 2024. She is easily the best cat either of us have ever met and we will miss her forever.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Writing is fun (but don't do it as often as I'd like).</h4>
        <p>
          I recently realized I needed more mentally stimulating hobbies than watching reality television, which is my shameless pleasure. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As you have gathered, I like to talk my silliness, so I thought writing short-form content could be fun! Sorta the artsy yang to the coding yin. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While I plan to use what I learn about web development for work, writing is more of a hobby for me. I find that between life, family, friends, and work, it can sometimes get put on the backburner (to the point that I have to shoehorn it into my coding portfolio). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Would love to <a href="./contact.html">connect</a> with people who also like writing for fun to keep us on track with our hobby.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>I have managed to turn regular awkwardness into quirky, functional awkwardness.</h4>
        <p>
          This is probably the most important unimportant fact about me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I entered the workforce, I found myself challenged by customer/user-facing roles. Similarly, when I entered big-time, real-deal adulthood, I found myself challenged by friend-making in an environment without classes and clubs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          What I needed was to find a way to communicate properly and pleasantly, but what I wanted was to be myself at the same time: my socially-awkward, prefers-to-be-at-home, hates-eye-contact, doesn't-ever-know-what-she's-supposed-to-do-with-her-hands self. 
        </p>
        <p>I like to say I never got the social conventions manual that everyone else seemed to get when they were born, but I managed to piece together the rules eventually. And while I may never be the life of the party— on the contrary, I'll probabably go home early— I can get by in a world where connections are crucial, and have been able to maintain relationships that I truly value.</p>
